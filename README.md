About
The TinyC Compiler is a simple, educational compiler for a subset of the C programming language, 
specifically designed to introduce basic concepts of compiler construction. This project demonstrates 
the fundamental components of a compiler, including lexical analysis, syntax parsing, semantic 
checking, and code generation.
